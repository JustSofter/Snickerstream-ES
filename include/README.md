# Discontinuation of NTR UDF
**From now on, I'm discontinuing the development of NTR UDF.** The version included here might reference some functions used
internally by Snickerstream and, as such, is not suited to be used with other projects as-is.

I've made this decision because no one really seemed to use it for their own projects and made Snickerstream's development
somewhat more difficult. If you need the old version for whatever reason, it now has [its own Github repo.](https://github.com/RattletraPM/NTR-UDF)
